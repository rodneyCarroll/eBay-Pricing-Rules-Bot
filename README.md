## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The user sets pricing rules through the Appilot dashboard (e.g., undercut by 5%, maintain 10% margin, or match competitor).  
2. **Core Logic** — The bot connects to eBay through an Android interface, fetching live listing and competitor data using UI Automator or Accessibility APIs.  
3. **Decision Engine** — Based on defined rules, the system recalculates optimal prices in real time.  
4. **Execution Layer** — The bot edits listings directly within the eBay Seller Hub or mobile app to update prices.  
5. **Logging and Reporting** — All changes are logged and synced to the dashboard for reporting, insights, and audit.
